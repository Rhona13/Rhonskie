                <p>     Sunflowers are incredibly useful.
                    Sunflowers are originally from North America and have been cultivated for over 4,500 years. This is partly because the entirety of the sunflower plant is edible, so the leaves, stalks, and roots could all be used as food. In fact, sunflowers were grown as food in North America before other crops such as corn became commonplace. 
                    
                    In addition, sunflowers were milled to create flour, and their seeds were roasted and eaten. As is still the case today, sunflower oil was used in cooking. The oil and pigments could also be used for various cosmetic applications such as dyes, and the stalk could be used in construction.
                    
                    Sunflowers became popular as a decorative flower when Spanish explorers brought the seeds back to Europe in the 1500s.</p>
